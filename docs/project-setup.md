# Project setup #

## Vagrantfile ##

The first step in configuring any Vagrant project is to create a Vagrantfile (or edit already present one). The purpose of the Vagrantfile is twofold:

1. Mark the root directory of your project. Many of the configuration options in Vagrant are relative to this root directory.

2. Describe the kind of machine and resources you need to run your project, as well as what software to install and how you want to access it.
