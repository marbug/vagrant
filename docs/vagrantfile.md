# Vagrantfile #

The primary function of the Vagrantfile is to describe the type of machine required for a project, and how to configure and provision these machines.

Vagrant is meant to run with one Vagrantfile per project, and the Vagrantfile is supposed to be committed to version control. This allows other developers involved in the project to check out the code, run vagrant up, and be on their way. Vagrantfiles are portable across every platform Vagrant supports.

The syntax of Vagrantfiles is Ruby, but knowledge of the Ruby programming language is not necessary to make modifications to the Vagrantfile, since it is mostly simple variable assignment. In fact, Ruby is not even the most popular community Vagrant is used within, which should help show you that despite not having Ruby knowledge, people are very successful with Vagrant.

## Lookup path ##

When you run any vagrant command, Vagrant climbs up the directory tree looking for the first Vagrantfile it can find, starting first in the current directory. So if you run vagrant in /home/mitchellh/projects/foo, it will search the following paths in order for a Vagrantfile, until it finds one:

    /home/mitchellh/projects/foo/Vagrantfile
    /home/mitchellh/projects/Vagrantfile
    /home/mitchellh/Vagrantfile
    /home/Vagrantfile
    /Vagrantfile

This feature lets you run vagrant from any directory in your project.

You can change the starting directory where Vagrant looks for a Vagrantfile by setting the VAGRANT_CWD environmental variable to some other path. (TODO)
